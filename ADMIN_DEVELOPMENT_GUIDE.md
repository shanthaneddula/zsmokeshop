## 🏗️ **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE**

### **Chosen Approach: File-Based JSON Storage**
```markdown
Rationale: Simple, version-controlled, zero infrastructure complexity
Perfect for: <100 products, rapid development, easy maintenance
Benefits: No database setup, Git-tracked changes, easy backups
```

### **Data Storage Strategy**
```
/src/data/
├── products.json (dynamic - managed by admin)
├── categories.json (dynamic - managed by admin)
├── index.ts (exports JSON data to existing components)
└── backup/ (automatic backups before updates)

/public/images/
├── products/ (uploaded product images)
└── categories/ (uploaded category images)
```

### **Technology Stack**
```typescript
Frontend: Next.js 13+ App Router + TypeScript
Styling: Tailwind CSS (Adidas-inspired design system)
Image Processing: browser-image-compression + Sharp (optional)
Forms: React Hook Form + Zod validation
Storage: Local filesystem (JSON + public images)
Authentication: Simple session-based admin auth
```

## 🖼️ **IMAGE HANDLING SYSTEM**

### **Image Upload Workflow**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Selects Image] --> B[Client-Side Compression]
    B --> C[Generate Filename]
    C --> D[Upload to /api/admin/upload]
    D --> E[Save to /public/images/products/]
    E --> F[Return Public URL]
    F --> G[Update Product JSON]
    G --> H[Cleanup Old Images]
```

### **Image Processing Specifications**
```typescript
// Client-Side Compression Settings
const imageCompressionOptions = {
  maxSizeMB: 0.8, // Max file size
  maxWidthOrHeight: 1200, // Max dimension
  useWebWorker: true, // Better performance
  fileType: 'image/webp', // Optimal format
  quality: 0.85 // Balance quality/size
};

// Filename Generation Pattern
const generateFilename = (productId: string, originalName: string) => {
  const timestamp = Date.now();
  const sanitized = originalName.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9.-]/g, '');
  return `${productId}_${timestamp}_${sanitized}.webp`;
};

// Supported Image Formats
const SUPPORTED_FORMATS = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/webp'];
const MAX_FILE_SIZE = 5 * 1024 * 1024; // 5MB
```

### **Image Storage Structure**
```
/public/images/
├── products/
│   ├── prod_1698765432_smok-nord-4.webp
│   ├── prod_1698765433_voopoo-drag.webp

## 🔐 **AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM**

### **Simple Session-Based Auth**
```typescript
// Environment Variables
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_here
SESSION_DURATION=24h

// Authentication Flow
1. Admin enters credentials on /admin/login
2. Server validates against environment variables
3. JWT token created and stored in httpOnly cookie
4. Middleware protects all /admin routes
5. Token expires after 24 hours
```

### **Security Middleware**
```typescript
// /src/middleware.ts
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server';
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';

export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  // Protect admin routes
  if (request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/admin')) {
    const token = request.cookies.get('admin-token')?.value;
    
    if (!token) {
      return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/admin/login', request.url));
    }
    
    try {
      jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET!);
      return NextResponse.next();
    } catch {
      return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/admin/login', request.url));
    }
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/admin/:path*']
};
```

    border: '#E5E5E5', // Border gray
    text: {
      primary: '#000000',
      secondary: '#666666',
      muted: '#999999'
    }
  },

```typescript
// Admin Button Component
const AdminButton = ({ variant, children, ...props }) => {
  const baseClasses = `
    inline-flex items-center justify-center
    border border-gray-900 dark:border-white
    px-6 py-3 text-sm font-black uppercase tracking-wide
    transition-all duration-300
    hover:bg-gray-900 hover:text-white
    dark:hover:bg-white dark:hover:text-gray-900
  `;
  
  const variants = {
    primary: 'bg-gray-900 text-white',
    secondary: 'bg-white text-gray-900',
    danger: 'border-red-600 text-red-600 hover:bg-red-600 hover:text-white'
  };
  
  return (
    <button className={`${baseClasses} ${variants[variant]}`} {...props}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};

// Admin Form Input
const AdminInput = ({ label, error, ...props }) => (
  <div className="space-y-2">
    <label className="block text-sm font-black uppercase tracking-wide text-gray-900">
      {label}
    </label>
    <input
      className={`
        w-full border border-gray-300 px-4 py-3
        text-sm font-medium
        focus:border-gray-900 focus:outline-none
        ${error ? 'border-red-500' : ''}
      `}
      {...props}
    />
    {error && (
      <p className="text-sm text-red-600 font-medium">{error}</p>
    )}
  </div>
);
```

### **🔧 TECHNICAL INSIGHTS: API Response Structure Pattern**

**Root Cause Analysis:**
Multiple critical issues (Issues 4-7) were caused by the same API response structure mismatch pattern. The backend APIs consistently return data in a nested structure, but frontend components were accessing the wrong level. This pattern affected categories loading, image uploads, products listing, and edit functionality.

**Standard API Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    // Actual data payload here
    "categories": [...],
    "products": [...],
    "url": "/path/to/image.jpg",
    "pagination": { "totalProducts": 5, "totalPages": 1 }
  }
}
```

**Common Frontend Mistakes:**
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG - Direct access
setCategories(data.categories);
setImageUrl(data.url);
setProducts(data.products);

// ✅ CORRECT - Nested access
setCategories(data.data.categories);
setImageUrl(data.data.url);
setProducts(data.data.products);
```

**Files Fixed:**
- `/src/app/admin/components/ProductForm.tsx` - Category dropdown + Image upload
- `/src/app/admin/components/CategoryForm.tsx` - Image upload
- `/src/app/admin/categories/categories-client.tsx` - Categories listing + Delete functionality
- `/src/app/admin/products/products-client.tsx` - Products listing + Category filter + Delete functionality
- `/src/app/admin/products/edit/[id]/edit-product-client.tsx` - Edit product API response structure
- `/src/app/admin/categories/edit/[id]/edit-category-client.tsx` - Edit category API response structure
- `/src/app/api/shop/categories/route.ts` - Shop categories API filtering and product counts
- `/src/data/products.json` - Cleaned dummy test products

**Prevention Strategy:**
All admin API endpoints now follow consistent response structure. Future components should always access nested data via `response.data.data.*` pattern.
