 Critical Issues Identified:
1. Scroll Snap Container (HIGH PRIORITY)
Issue: Fixed height: 100vh on .scroll-snap-container causes aggressive snap behavior
Impact: Prevents natural scrolling, jumps between sections instead of smooth transitions
Mobile Impact: Particularly problematic on mobile where viewport height varies
2. Section Height Inconsistency (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
Issue: FeaturedProducts section uses different height approach than other sections
Impact: Inconsistent scroll snap alignment and visual rhythm
3. Mobile Carousel UX (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
Issue: Auto-scroll carousels may interfere with touch gestures
Impact: Poor mobile user experience, conflicts with swipe navigation
4. Banner Height Mismatch (LOW PRIORITY)
Issue: Banner context height (52px) â‰  CSS top offset (2.7rem = 43.2px)
Impact: Potential layout misalignment in header positioning
ðŸ“‹ Recommended Fixes (In Priority Order):
Phase 1: Critical Scroll Issues
Fix scroll snap container - Remove fixed height, apply scroll snap to document body
Standardize section heights - Use consistent min-h-[90vh] across all sections
Improve scroll behavior - Implement smoother scroll snap transitions
Phase 2: Mobile UX Enhancements
Enhance carousel touch interactions - Pause auto-scroll on user interaction

Audit keyboard navigation - Verify accessibility for modals and carousels
ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps:
The most impactful fix would be addressing the scroll snap container height issue, as it directly affects the core navigation experience. Would you like me to implement the scroll snap fixes first, or would you prefer to tackle a different priority area?
