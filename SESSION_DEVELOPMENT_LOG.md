## üîç **TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE**

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **Announcement Bar Problems**
```typescript
Issue: Banner scrolls away instead of staying fixed
Solution: Ensure outer div has 'fixed' class, inner motion.div handles animations only

Issue: Gap appears above banner on scroll
Solution: Verify header positioning uses top-[2.7rem] to account for banner height

Issue: Mobile text gets cut off
Solution: Check mobile-specific text variants in announcement messages array
```

#### **Sitemap Issues**
```typescript
Issue: Sitemaps not accessible at /sitemap.xml
Solution: Verify sitemap.ts files are in /src/app/ directory and rebuild project

Issue: Wrong domain in sitemap URLs
Solution: Update baseUrl variable in all sitemap files before production deploy

Issue: Missing categories in sitemap
Solution: Check categories data import in sitemap-categories.ts
```

#### **Chat Integration Problems**
```typescript
Issue: PuffBuddy chat not opening
Solution: Verify Tawk.to script is loaded and window.Tawk_API exists

Issue: Floating prompt appears too early
Solution: Adjust timeout in useEffect from 15000ms to desired delay

Issue: Chat prompt persists after dismissal
Solution: Check localStorage key 'chatPromptDismissed' functionality
```
