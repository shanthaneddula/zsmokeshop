---

## üîç **TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE**

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **Announcement Bar Problems**
```typescript
Issue: Banner scrolls away instead of staying fixed
Solution: Ensure outer div has 'fixed' class, inner motion.div handles animations only

Issue: Gap appears above banner on scroll
Solution: Verify header positioning uses top-[2.7rem] to account for banner height

Issue: Mobile text gets cut off
Solution: Check mobile-specific text variants in announcement messages array
```

#### **Sitemap Issues**
```typescript
Issue: Sitemaps not accessible at /sitemap.xml
Solution: Verify sitemap.ts files are in /src/app/ directory and rebuild project

Issue: Wrong domain in sitemap URLs
Solution: Update baseUrl variable in all sitemap files before production deploy

Issue: Missing categories in sitemap
Solution: Check categories data import in sitemap-categories.ts
```

#### **Chat Integration Problems**
```typescript
Issue: PuffBuddy chat not opening
Solution: Verify Tawk.to script is loaded and window.Tawk_API exists

Issue: Floating prompt appears too early
Solution: Adjust timeout in useEffect from 15000ms to desired delay

Issue: Chat prompt persists after dismissal
Solution: Check localStorage key 'chatPromptDismissed' functionality
```

## üîß **CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED**

### **Banner Positioning Issue Resolution**
**Problem**: Banner overlapped header on desktop; dismissing banner left gap
**Root Cause**: Static header positioning with no state communication
**Solution**: 
- Implemented BannerContext for state management
- Made header positioning dynamic and responsive
- Added smooth transitions for professional UX
- Fixed hydration mismatches for SSR compatibility

### **Dropdown Menu Disappearing Issue**
**Problem**: Dropdown disappeared when moving cursor from "SHOP" to menu
**Root Cause**: Insufficient hover area and small invisible bridge
**Solution**:
- Extended hover areas following Amazon/eBay patterns
- Implemented dynamic invisible bridge responsive to banner state
- Added smooth animations matching Apple/Nike standards
- Enhanced accessibility with larger interaction zones

### **Navigation Routing Inconsistency**
**Problem**: "SHOP NOW" buttons pointed to /products instead of /shop
**Root Cause**: Inconsistent routing across components
**Solution**:
- Updated hero section and featured products CTAs
- Verified header "SHOP" link dual functionality
- Established consistent navigation flow to main shop page
- Maintained category-specific routing through dropdown

### **Shop Page Design Mismatch**

- Added responsive search/filter functionality
- Created server/client component separation for performance

### **Admin Interface Layout Consistency**
**Problem**: Gap between sidebar and main content on admin pages; inconsistent spacing

- Updated header styling to `text-3xl` for consistency across all pages
- Implemented responsive padding (mobile: `p-6`, desktop: `sm:p-8`)
- Fixed React key prop warnings for better performance
- Eliminated visual gaps and achieved professional layout uniformity

### **Admin Forms Border Styling Modernization**
**Problem**: Thick, aggressive borders in Add Product and Add Category forms
**Root Cause**: High-contrast `border-gray-900 dark:border-white` styling inconsistent with dashboard
**Solution**:
- Updated all form borders to subtle `border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700`
- Modified container backgrounds to `dark:bg-gray-800` matching dashboard cards
- Updated focus rings to `focus:ring-gray-500 dark:focus:ring-gray-400`

## üîß **BUILD FIXES & DEPLOYMENT READINESS** *(Session Extension - July 23, 2025)*

### **Critical Build Errors Resolved**

#### **1. Obsolete Category Route Removal**
```typescript
Problem: Build failing due to deleted CategoryPageClient component reference
File: /src/app/category/[slug]/page.tsx
Error: Module not found: Can't resolve '@/components/CategoryPageClient'

Solution:
- Removed entire /category/[slug] route directory
- This route was obsolete since we use /shop with category filtering
- Eliminates confusion between /category and /shop pages

Commit: 9b3af0f4 - "fix: remove obsolete category route causing build failure"
```

#### **2. TypeScript Compliance Issues**
```typescript
Problem 1: Locations page phone number undefined error
File: /src/app/locations/page.tsx:95
Error: Argument of type 'string | undefined' not assignable to 'string'

Solution:
- Added null check: {location.phone && (
- Used non-null assertion: onClick={() => callStore(location.phone!)}
- Only renders phone button when phone number exists

Problem 2: ProductCard originalPrice property doesn't exist
File: /src/components/product/ProductCard.tsx:129,225
Error: Property 'originalPrice' does not exist on type 'Product'

Solution:
- Updated to use salePrice from Product interface
- Fixed pricing logic: ${product.salePrice ? product.salePrice.toFixed(2) : product.price.toFixed(2)}
- Show original price as strikethrough when salePrice exists
```

#### **3. Next.js Suspense Boundary Error**
```typescript
Problem: useSearchParams() prerendering error
File: /src/app/shop/page.tsx
Error: useSearchParams() should be wrapped in a suspense boundary

Solution:
- Wrapped ShopPageClient in Suspense boundary
- Added loading fallback: <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
- Fixes static generation during build process

Commit: 258bed20 - "fix: resolve build errors and TypeScript issues"
```

### **Build Success Metrics**
